Implement the Lucas-Kanade tracker for a) pure translational model and b) a six parameter affine model and test on sample videos. Write the code for the recursive Gauss-Newton process yourself (please do not use a library). You can use standard libraries for matrix operations.
Do the same with OpenCV and compare the performance.
Use both to implement and application like image mosaicing or video stabilization.
Please submit a report providing details of your implementation, experiments and observations.
